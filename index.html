                <p>If you want to play basketball there's certain equipment you need to have and certain things you need to do to be fully ready to play basketball.</p>
                <h3>How to Play Basketball:</h3>
                <p>Basketball is a very mobile sport that requires a lot of running. The game starts off with two even teams (most of the time teams of 5) and one person from each team jump in the center of the court for the ball first. Whoever gets the ball that team gets to try and score at the basketball first. The other team will be playing defense and trying to stop your team from scoring. When you shoot and the team gets the rebound or when you score you go to the other side of the court and the other team will try and score at the opposite basket. Points are counted by twos if you are in front of the 3 point line and they count by threes if you make a shot behind the 3 point line. If a person is fouled that person gets to shoot 2 or 3 free throws depending on where they are on the court. If you are in front of the 3 point line you will get 2 shots and if you are behind the 3 point line you will get 3 shots. However if you make the shot while being fouled they will counted the points and you will get to shoot 1 more free throw no matter where you are. They only difference is if you shoot a 2 pointer it will be a chance for a 3 point play and if you shoot a 3 pointer you will get a chance for a 4 point play. The team the ends up with the most points at the end of 4 quarters wins the game.</p>

                <h3>Equipment:</h3>
                <h3>When playing basketball there’s some specific equipment that is needed:</h3>
                <p> Sneakers are a very important thing to have because if a person is playing in dress shoes or sandals there is a very good chance that person will get hurt.</p> 
                
                   <p> Have a pair of shorts and a T-Shirt when playing because if a person is playing in a sweater and jeans you will get very very warm and you might dehydrate or pass out and that is not safe for the game.</p>
                   <p>Have a basketball to play with and practice with.</p> 
                   <p>This doesn’t have to be worn but I recommend this very much, I recommend that you get knee pads, arm sleeves, a mouth piece, and an ankle brace. Now I don’t think you should get this stuff if you are absolutely healthy but if you are feeling pain in any part of you body while playing basketball you should get one of these items depending on the part of the body that hurts.</p>
