                <p>If you want to play basketball there's certain equipment you need to have and certain things you need to do to be fully ready to play basketball.</p>
                <h3>How to Play Basketball:</h3>
                <p>Basketball is a very mobile sport that requires a lot of running. The game starts off with two even teams (most of the time teams of 5) and one person from each team jump in the center of the court for the ball first. Whoever gets the
                    ball that team gets to try and score at the basketball first. The other team will be playing defense and trying to stop your team from scoring. When you shoot and the team gets the rebound or when you score you go to the other side
                    of the court and the other team will try and score at the opposite basket. Points are counted by twos if you are in front of the 3 point line and they count by threes if you make a shot behind the 3 point line. If a person is fouled
                    that person gets to shoot 2 or 3 free throws depending on where they are on the court. If you are in front of the 3 point line you will get 2 shots and if you are behind the 3 point line you will get 3 shots. However if you make the
                    shot while being fouled they will counted the points and you will get to shoot 1 more free throw no matter where you are. They only difference is if you shoot a 2 pointer it will be a chance for a 3 point play and if you shoot a 3
                    pointer you will get a chance for a 4 point play. The team the ends up with the most points at the end of 4 quarters wins the game.</p>

                    <h3>Equipment:</h3>
                    <h3>When playing basketball there’s some specific equipment that is needed:</h3>
                    <p> Sneakers are a very important thing to have because if a person is playing in dress shoes or sandals there is a very good chance that person will get hurt.</p>

                    <p> Have a pair of shorts and a T-Shirt when playing because if a person is playing in a sweater and jeans you will get very very warm and you might dehydrate or pass out and that is not safe for the game.</p>
                    <p>Have a basketball to play with and practice with.</p>
                    <p>This doesn’t have to be worn but I really recommend this, I recommend that you get knee pads, arm sleeves, a mouth piece, and an ankle brace. Now I don’t think you should get this stuff if you are absolutely healthy but if you are
                        feeling pain in any part of you body while playing basketball you should get one of these items depending on the part of the body that hurts.</p>
                    <h2>Here Are Some Examples Of Equipment:</h2>

                <h2 class="text-center">How To Get Involved In Basketball:</h2>
                <p>There are many leagues around the country that offer to teach basketball. They usually start at a very young age like around 3-4 and most end when the child ends high school. The goal for these leagues are to get the kids better at the
                    game so they can make a high school team, then move up to getting a college scholarship and playing for a college. Also after college if you work hard enough you might be able to be a professional basketball player. </p>

            <div class="jumbotron" id="My Recommendations">
                <h2 class="text-center">My Recommendations</h2>
                <h3>This is some advice I have when trying to play basketball: </h3>

                <p>Be ready to work very hard. If you are determined and focused on Basketball you have a chance to make it very far in life.</p>

                <p>Practice a lot because if you practice shooting, passing, and dribbling from the start you will get a lot better at the game.</p>

                <p> Coaches will be very tough on you to work harder. So be ready to maybe get yelled at if you are doing bad.</p>

                <p>Don’t quit because if you quit you will regret it and you won’t play in games as much.</p>

                <p>Get good grades in school because most coaches won't even let you on the team if you arent applying yourself with your school work.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="jumbotron" id="How To Get Involved At Home:">
                <h2 class="text-center">How To Get Involved At Home</h2>
                <p>Watch Basketball games on TV and become a fan. College or NBA are both good.</p>
                <p>Get involved with social media. Follow the NBA on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram to see what’s going on in the league.</p>
                <p>Workout at home: Everyday do some pushups and situps and pullsups or anything that can help you get better. As the days increase maybe increase the number of workouts you do a day so you can get stronger. Maybe go for a run so you can
                    get faster.</p>
